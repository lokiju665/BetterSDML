BetterSDML – ReadMe 🇬🇧
=====================

A small plug-and-play kit to launch Stable Diffusion WebUI – DirectML more easily on AMD GPUs.

This project includes:
- Batch scripts to start and restart the AI easily
- VRAM reset utility (clean shutdown + restart)
- Integrated Brave Portable (auto-installed)
- Custom desktop icon

⚙️ How it works:
1. Launch `Lancer-StableDiffusion.exe`
2. Enable or skip auto-restart via `VRAM-Option.bat`
3. Use `Reset-VRAM.bat` to free VRAM without closing everything manually

📦 Important:
- You need a working install of `stable-diffusion-webui-directml`
- Either copy it here or install it in this folder

Tested on RX 6800 XT (16 GB) – Windows 10
